# Explainable Sentiment Analysis using Hotel Reviews

## Project Description
When travelling to a new place one of the most hectic tasks is to search for a good place to stay. On various travel websites, one finds multiple listings of hotels which can generally be filtered by the ratings. But even so, one would have to read through many reviews to make sure that the amenities that they are looking for are up to the mark for a given hotel. This is where our project comes in...

We train a model on a dataset that has user reviews for a hotel and the corresponding ratings. What is expected of the model is to understand what a positive review looks like and then predict the nature of the reviews that it has not seen before. Once we have found out the sentiment of the review, we employ techniques like dependency parsing and SHAP analysis to find the relevant attributes that make these sentiments positive. So basically we predict if the stay at the hotel will be great and if so, what is it that actually makes it great.
